# calculator

This experiment has realized four arithmetic topic generators, which support mode selection and parameter setting.

Instructions:

Several formulas will be generated, including integers in the range [0,20) 
and operators: addition[+]/subtraction[-]/multiplication[*]/division[/]/power[**|^].
Brackets['(' and ')'] is also supported.
Note that the number of operators cannot exceed 10.
And the answer and intermediate calculation result won't be larger than 1e10 or smaller than 1e-8.
There is no decimals or root symbols, such as "0.123" or "âˆš2" [2^(0.5)].
Give your answer in the format including no more than one "+" operator with integers and fractions.
Such as 123/45, 1+78/45, 2+33/45.
After the program exits, you can see the log file in folder "./logs".
Start the program with "start 10" and enjoy!

It's not case sensitive.
enter "exit" or "quit" to force exit.
enter "setting" to view settings in any time.
To change power type, enter "setpower"+[number], e.g. "setpower 1".
To change operation numbers, enter "setopnum"+[number], e.g. "setopnum 5".
If you are ready, enter "start"+[number of formulas], e.g. "start 10".
To submit an answer, enter "answer"+[your answer], e.g. "answer 5/2".
To submit an custom formula and ask for an answer, enter "calc"+[your formula], e.g "calc 2^(-3)**3".
